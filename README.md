Hi there, this repo contains challenges I wrote for UNSW SecSoc CTF (19T2). The writeups are linked [here](https://joshuakwong.github.io/secsocCTFmyChallenges/). 

There are 4 challenges:
1. 64seBA
- crypto challenge
- don't use open decode.py unless you really don't know how to do it

2. EnCrYpT
- crypto challenge

3. bufff
- simple binary challenge
- try to solve it without source code first

4. Reference Letter
- pdf forensics challenge
- if you are not using vim you are doing it wrong
